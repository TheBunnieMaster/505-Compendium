# Voteless

**Classification:** Fodder
**Threat level:** Minimum to High

---


## Strengths:

Members of the Voteless horde are capable only of recklessly charging at anything Democratic, chasing after freedom fighters with the kind of mindless zeal that only comes from being completely and utterly indoctrinated by their alien masters. While pitifully weak individually (if you can even call them that anymore), their main strength lies in their sheer endless number. If their presence is not managed or communicated, Helldivers will quickly find themselves overwhelmed and backed into a corner with no way out.

## Weaknesses:

As fodder-class enemies, Voteless are weak to the vast majority of the SEAF arsenal. With no armour protecting them, headshots result in immediate target termination, and leg-shots dismember them, reducing their movement speed to a crawl and putting them into a bleed-out state.

## Recommended strategies:

Ensure accurate communication of horde or group locations and directions. Aim for the legs to reduce their movement speed. Sentries, movement-impairing stratagems and flame, gas, or other crowd-control stratagems or weapons work well.

## Alternative strategies:

Aim for the head for an instant kill, less reliable than aiming for legs.
