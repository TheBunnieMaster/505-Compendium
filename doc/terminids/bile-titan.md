# Bile Titan

**Classification:** Heavy
**Threat Level:** High

---

## Strengths
Bile Titans are giant brutes prodigious in size and relentless in pursuit. They have evolved a thick carapace covering the entirety of their four long legs, that they use to jab and stomp at any who get close as well as bypassing any environmental obstructions. Its body shares this same carapace for the most part. It can also release a large stream of acidic bile from its face, transmuting most of what it touches to a puddle on the floor.

## Weaknesses
The underside of its body is entirely unarmoured as that is where it stores its bile. These bile sacs can be destroyed, rendering it incapable of spewing bile.

## Recommended Strategies:
For a quick target drop, aim anti-tank weaponry with sufficient firepower directly at its face. Heavy firepower support from eagles or orbitals also function well in producing bile titan corpses.

## Alternative Strategies:
With enough dedication and careful footwork, a Helldiver can bring down a bile titan with nothing but a primary, a secondary if your footwork is exceptional, provided most, if not all of your shots hit the bile sacs underneath. The armour on its back can be blown apart, revealing the unprotected flesh underneath, enough firepower directed at its exposed back will eventually drop the target.
