# Stalker

**Classification:** Medium
**Threat Level:** High

---

## Strengths
Near-perfect cloaking capabilities, high-speed pouncing claw attacks that tear through armour and flesh alike. Has a tongue attack that temporarily renders gravity inoperable to warriors of liberty struck by the attack, regeneration ability while cloaked. Very high natural agility.

## Weaknesses
The target is armoured only in light armour-classed carapace, most small firearms will inflict damage, will retreat and cloak after sustaining enough damage. Vulnerable to gas and flame-based weaponry. Emits a notable low guttural growl.

## Recommended Strategies:
Employ high-vigilance tactics when personal position is within suspected target territory, in addition to buddy system tactics. Focus fire each target and make locating the Stalker Lair a top priority.
