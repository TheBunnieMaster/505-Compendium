# Charger

**Classification:** Heavy
**Threat Level:** Medium

## Strengths
Near-complete resistance to small arms. As the name suggests, the target's primary method of impeding the march of managed democracy is charging and crushing targets under its sheer weight. Its natural armour is shaped so that it can deflect anti-tank rounds, and the heavy weight of the target barges vehicles out of the way and reduces exosuits to scrap.

## Weaknesses
Its heavy carapace tapers off towards the rear of the target, making that spot vulnerable to small arms. It has no armour underneath its body. Its cumbersome weight makes making sharp turns difficult.

## Recommended Strategies:
Shooting its face with anti-tank will eliminate the target immediately, provided the shot is not from an awkward angle. Shearing off the armour on its middle will lead it to bleed out. Its front two legs' armour can be blasted off with anti-tank, allowing small arms to finish the job. If its rear end sustains enough damage, it will enter a terminal bleed out. When engaged, try to bait out the charge and dodge to the side as it gets closer. You need not commit to a dive, simply running out of the way will work just as well.
