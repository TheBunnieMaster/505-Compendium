## Specifications
Devastators are modular bipedal battle bots capable of being mounted with a variety of weaponry. All units feature medium-class torso plating and light armor on their locomotion systems.

* **Standard Devastator:** Equipped with a standard burst-fire blaster and a reinforced steel fist.
* **Rocket Devastator:** A direct upgrade featuring back-mounted rocket pods for firing long-range salvos.
* **Heavy Devastator:** The legion's suppressors. They utilize a right-mounted fusion repeater fed by a back-mounted supply and carry a heavy shield.
* **Conflagration Devastator:** A sidegrade replacing the blaster with an incendiary shotgun and a heavy shield.
* **Incendiary MG Devastator:** A heavy variant utilizing specialized incendiary ammunition in its fusion repeater.

## Weaknesses
The central control systems ("heads") are vulnerable to light penetration and above. The back-mounted ammo supplies on Heavy variants can be targeted and destroyed. Additionally, the legs and arms are less armored and susceptible to all forms of firepower.

## Recommended Strategies:
Crowd control weaponry or explosive stratagems like grenade launchers work best, as these units typically deploy in squads. Always prioritize General Brasch’s "Three Cs": Courage, Cover, and more Cover. Precision long-range weapons like marksman rifles can safely pick them off from a distance.

## Alternative Strategies:
If the head is too difficult to hit, aim for the lightly armored legs to hobble their movement. Alternatively, arms can be shot off to neutralize their primary weaponry. While headshots require deadly focus, a skilled marksman can sweep entire squadrons in seconds by exploiting this critical flaw.
