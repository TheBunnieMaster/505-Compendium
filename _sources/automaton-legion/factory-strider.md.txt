# Factory Strider

**Classification:** Heavy
**Threat Level:** High

---

## Specifications
The Factory Strider is a massive, quadrupedal armored siege-bot. It serves as a mobile fortress, capable of intermittently deploying small squads of non-heavy automatons from its underside.

* **Standard Variant:** Features two fusion gatling guns mounted under the "face" and one large burst-fire cannon mounted on its back.
* **Jammer Variant:** Replaces the back cannon with a miniaturized stratagem jammer. This device scrambles Helldiver forearm-mounted communication devices, causing stratagem codes to randomize while within range.

## Weaknesses
The primary and most accessible weakness is the deployment hatch (the "belly") located on its underside. Additionally, a very small "eye" port on the front of its cranial radar assembly is vulnerable to precise fire.

## Recommended Strategies:
Prioritize the destruction of the "face"-mounted gatlings and the back-mounted cannon/jammer before closing in. The cannon requires anti-tank ordinance, while the gatlings can be disabled with medium-penetration weaponry. Once neutralized, apply anti-tank fire to the underside hatch. While difficult, the "eye" weakness is a viable target for skilled marksmen.

## Alternative Strategies:
Use heavy anti-tank fire to peel away sections of its external armor plating. This reveals the unit's inner circuitry and mechanical systems; once exposed, apply liberal amounts of firepower to these internal vulnerabilities to bring the titan down.
